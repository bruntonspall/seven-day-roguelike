TODO

This is the list of tasks that I think need to be done before I'm happy that this is at least 1.0 material.
They are started at the root level as large tasks, and may be broken down into hour long tasks or so, since most of the work is being done in hour long segments.
I'm also keeping track of known bugs that are intending on being fixed.
This is not really in priority order, just whatever order.

## Dev Tasks
* Improved vision casting, use a floodfill algorithm to find squares to test
* Save game state
* Quit / Suicide options to reset game
* Restore game state
* Monsters can hit you
* Monsters can see you
* Monsters go to last known good position
* Monsters have alert status and thresholds
* Monsters communicate with each other
* Players have limited ammo? (or need to reload)
* Global map shouldn't be visible if it's not visible
* Explored map that can't be seen should be displayed differently
* Squad display on right hand side
* Squadies should have health, armour and other status indicators
* Detect game completion
* Allow for retreat out of mission.

## Technical epics
* API driven system?
* Keyboard input in browser
* Squad UI

## Design tasks
